## Data

### Databases. (located in `data/databases` and `data/swc`):

These are the raw and external database files used in this study.

- Original composite protein network. (`data/swc/data_yeast.txt`)
  - This is the yeast composite protein network used in SWC [[12]](#12).
  - This has the following features: TOPO, TOPO_L2, STRING, and CO_OCCUR.

  - Link: https://irefindex.vib.be/wiki/index.php/README_MITAB2.6_for_iRefIndex_19.0
- DIP PPIN [[9]](#9). (`data/databases/Scere20170205.txt`)
  - Version 2017-02-05 was used, which was downloaded from the DIP website.
  - Link: https://dip.doe-mbi.ucla.edu/dip/Main.cgi
- CYC2008 [[7]](#7). (`data/swc/complexes_CYC.txt`)
  - This was already provided by the SWC software package.

### Preprocessed Data. (`data/preprocessed`)

Preprocessed data can be found here. The cross-validation splits used by both XGW and SWC can also be found here (`data/preprocessed/cross_val_table.csv` and `data/preprocessed/dip_cross_val_table.csv`).

### Clusters. (`data/clusters`)

This is where the MCL algorithm software outputs its predicted clusters (after running `src/run_mcl.sh`, see the next sections).

### Evaluations. (`data/evals`)

This is where evaluation data are stored (precision-recall AUC, log loss, Brier score loss, etc...)

### Scores. (`data/scores`)

This is where the feature scores are stored (TOPO, TOPO_L2, STRING, CO_OCCUR, REL, CO_EXP, GO_CC, GO_BP, GO_MF).

### SWC data. (`data/swc`)

This is where the data that are provided and/or needed by SWC are stored.

### Training (`data/training`)

Hyperparameter settings are stored here based on previous training, as well as the computed feature importances.

### Weighted (`data/weighted`)

The weighted protein networks computed from all the 19 weighting methods.

## Source code. (`src/`)

All the source codes of XGW are stored here.

`preprocessor.py` - Preprocesses data in `data/databases` and stores preprocessed data to `data/preprocessed`. This is run only once (if `data/preprocessed`) is empty.

`dip_preprocessor.py` - Preprocesses raw DIP PPIN and constructs the base composite network for this network by topologically weighting it (TOPO and TOPO_L2), and integrating STRING and CO_OCCUR features.

`co_exp_scoring.py` and `rel_scoring.py` - Scores the Original and DIP composite network based on CO_EXP and REL.

`weighting.py` - Weights the two composite networks using the 19 weighting methods. Also, outputs the feature importances of XGW to `data/training`. Running this script takes a lot of time. If you want to rerun this script yourself, change the `re_weight` variable to `True` in the `main` method call. For more information, see the comments in this file.

`evaluate_comp_edges.py` - This evaluates the co-complex edge classification performance of each method. If you want to rerun this script yourself, change the `re_eval` variable to `True` in the `main` method call. For more information, see the notes in the comments of this file.

`evaluate_clusters.py` - This evaluates the cluster prediction performance of each method. If you want to rerun this script yourself, change the `re_eval` variable to `True` in the `main` method call. For more information, see the notes in the comments of this file.

`visualize_results.py` - This outputs all the tables and figures included in the paper.

The following sequence is how the scripts were run in order from the very start to the very end, assuming that `data/databases` were already given.

`preprocessor.py` > `dip_preprocessor.py` > `co_exp_scoring.py` > `rel_scoring.py` > TCSS (see next section) > SWC (see next section) > `weighting.py` > `evaluate_comp_edges.py` > `evaluate_clusters.py` > `visualize_results.py`.

## Results and Supplementary Materials

Results (figures) can be found in `results/`. These graphs were derived from performance evaluations in `data/evals/` and `data/training/` (for the feature importances). Moreover, a supplementary material document is also provided here (`SupplementaryMaterial.pdf`).

## External Software packages/services used

### TCSS. (`TCSS/`)

This study uses the Topological Clustering Semantic Similarity (TCSS) [[6]](#6) software package proposed by Jain & Bader (2010) on their study: _An improved method for scoring protein-protein
interactions using semantic similarity within the gene ontology._

Requirements: Python.

Link: https://baderlab.org/Software/TCSS

TCSS is licensed under GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0. The said license can be found in the `TCSS/` directory. For more information, the readers are directed to `TCSS/README.md`.

Commands to run TCSS:

For the Original composite network:

`python TCSS/tcss.py -i data/preprocessed/swc_edges.csv -o data/scores/go_ss_scores.csv --drop="IEA" --gene=data/databases/sgd.gaf --go=data/databases/gene_ontology.obo`

to generate the GO-weighted network (`data/scores/go_ss_scores.csv`) used in the study.

For the DIP composite network, the following command was used:

`python TCSS/tcss.py -i data/preprocessed/dip_edges.csv -o data/scores/dip_go_ss_scores.csv --drop="IEA" --gene=data/databases/sgd.gaf --go=data/databases/gene_ontology.obo`

### SWC

This study also uses the SWC [[12]](#12) software package and source files. The SWC method was proposed by Yong et. al. (2012) on their study: _Supervised maximum-likelihood weighting of composite protein networks for complex prediction_. We would like to thank the authors of SWC, the main inspiration for this study, for permitting us to use their software and data.

Requirements: Perl.

Link: https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~wongls/projects/complexprediction/SWC-31oct14/

Commands to run SWC:

For the Original composite network:

`perl score_edges.pl -i data_yeast.txt -c complexes_CYC.txt -m x -x cross_val.csv -e 0 -o "swc"`

For the DIP composite network:

`perl score_edges.pl -i dip_data_yeast.txt -c complexes_CYC.txt -m x -x dip_cross_val.csv -e 0 -o "dip_swc"`

### MCL

The Markov Cluster (MCL) [[4]](#4)[[5]](#5)[[11]](#11) Algorithm was used to cluster the weighted protein networks.

Requirements: MCL.

Link: https://github.com/micans/mcl

To run MCL (assuming MCL is installed in `~/local/bin/mcl`), navigate to `src`, then run:

`./run_mcl.sh ../data/weighted/ ./ 4`

This command will run the MCL algorithm on the weighted protein networks in `data/weighted` with inflation parameter set to 4. Note that the inflation parameter can be set to arbitrary value, preferrable around the range of [2, 5].

Running the above command will output `out.{file}.csv.I40` files to `data/clusters`.

If you want to set inflation parameter to 2, run:

`./run_mcl.sh ../data/weighted/ ./ 2`

which will output `out.{file}.csv.I20` files to `data/clusters`.

### UniProt ID Mapping

The UniProt [[13]](#13) Retrieve/ID mapping service was used to map each UniProtKB AC/ID in the DIP PPIN to its corresponding KEGG entry (systematic name). This was used to produce KEGG mapping file in `data/databases/dip_uniprot_kegg_mapped.tsv`.

Link: https://www.uniprot.org/id-mapping

## Internal software packages used

The following software/packages were used in building XGW:

- Python 3.11.0 [[14]](#14)
- Polars 0.18.4 [[15]](#15)
- scikit-learn 1.3.0 [[16]](#16)
- XGBoost 1.7.6 [[17]](#17)
- matplotlib 3.7.1 [[18]](#18)
- seaborn 0.12.2 [[19]](#19)
- numpy 1.25.0 [[20]](#20)

## Setup and Installation

To install the required Python packages for XGW, create a Python virtual environment, then run the following command after activating the environment:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Also, make sure that you have already downloaded the SWC software (as well as Perl) and the MCL algorithm software. You do not need to download TCSS from their website since the said software package is already included in this repository.
